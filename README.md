**Sesh-7**: Just starting now.

**Blender**: 
I have been working on the shoulder armor but didn't make much progress so I didn't want to add anything to my blender website.

**MomWebsite**:
Mother send some stuff about what she was thinking she would like on her website so I will be creating an astro website for her as a tesing ground to see if she actually likes it.

**UnrealEngine**
I just installed and deleted UnrealEngine5(URE). I was huge, 20gbs and I had to install Xcode in order to use it. I wasn't able to run it because my computer isn't 
powerful enough.
